## ðŸŒŽ Project Overview

**Green Campus** is an innovative sustainability management platform designed for university campuses, addressing major 
challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions, resource waste, and inefficient energy use. Despite existing sustainability efforts, 
many institutions lack comprehensive, real-time tools to monitor and promote eco-friendly initiatives.

Green Campus fills this gap by providing a tech-driven solution that engages both students and staff through meaningful, actionable insights.

The system leverages IoT sensors to monitor real-time energy consumption and waste management across the campus.

### Key Features

1. **Smart Campus Energy Dashboard**
   - Displays real-time resource usage and calculates environmental impact metrics.
   - Provides users with insights into their energy consumption patterns, enabling informed decisions about resource usage.

2. **Gamified Eco-Points and Rewards System**
   - Incentivizes sustainable actions like walking, recycling, and carpooling.
   - Users can redeem their Eco-Points for QR code vouchers at campus establishments.
   - Includes a gamified Eco-Points and Rewards System that incentivizes sustainable actions like walking, recycling, and carpooling.
   - Users can redeem their Eco-Points for QR code vouchers at campus establishments.

3. **Smart Expiring Food Discount System**
   - Enables vendors to register items nearing expiration, helping to reduce food waste through dynamic discounting and real-time notifications.

By combining real-time monitoring, gamification, and user engagement, Green Campus promotes sustainable behaviors and 
drives long-term environmental impact, positioning itself as a model for universities worldwide striving for eco-friendly campus operations.
